# PhonePe_EDA_Dashborad
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.

Step 1: Extracting data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository
- Develop a script using a programming language such as Python to interact with the Phonepe pulse Github repository.
- Use a library like GitPython or PyGithub to clone the repository and retrieve the necessary data.

Step 2: Data Transformation, Cleaning, and Pre-processing
- Analyze the extracted data and identify the required fields for visualization.
- Perform data transformation, cleaning, and pre-processing steps as per the specific requirements of your analysis.
- This may include handling missing values, data formatting, filtering, or aggregating data.

Step 3: Inserting transformed data into a MySQL database
- Set up a MySQL database either locally or using a cloud-based service.
- Establish a connection to the database from your Python script.
- Define the necessary table schema based on the transformed data.
- Insert the cleaned and pre-processed data into the appropriate tables in the MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.

Step 4: Creating a live geo-visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly
- Install Streamlit and Plotly libraries in your Python environment.
- Develop a Streamlit application that serves as a dashboard for displaying the visualizations.
- Utilize Plotly's mapping capabilities to create interactive and visually appealing geo visualizations within the Streamlit app.
- Implement appropriate interactivity features like zooming, panning, or tooltips to enhance the user experience.

Step 5: Fetching data from the MySQL database for the dashboard
- Establish a connection to the MySQL database within your Streamlit application.
- Write queries to retrieve the required data from the MySQL tables.
- Use the retrieved data to generate visualizations and populate the dashboard with the latest information.

Step 6: Provide dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures
- Integrate dropdown menus within the Streamlit app to allow users to select different criteria for data visualization.
- Write the necessary logic to dynamically update the visualizations based on the selected dropdown options.
- Ensure that there are at least 10 different dropdown options available, providing a diverse range of facts and figures for users to explore.

Security Considerations:
- Implement secure authentication mechanisms for accessing the dashboard and the underlying MySQL database.
- Use encryption techniques when storing sensitive data, such as database credentials.
- Regularly update the dependencies and libraries used in your solution to ensure security patches are applied promptly.

Efficiency Considerations:
- Optimize the data retrieval and processing steps to minimize response times and resource utilization.
- Utilize indexing and query optimization techniques in the MySQL database to improve retrieval performance.

User-Friendliness:
- Design the dashboard interface to be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Include appropriate labels, tooltips, and instructions to guide users in interacting with the dashboard.
- Conduct user testing and gather feedback to refine and improve the user experience.
